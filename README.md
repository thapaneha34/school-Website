The website is created to provide student, parents, teachers with easy access to school-related information and resources. It acts as a centralized hub where all stakeholders-students, parents, teachers, and staff-can access important information in one place. It provides a platform for enhanced communication between parents and teachers. Features like contact forms, email links and so on. It hosts a variety of academic resources, including study materials, assignments, syllabus, and supplementary learning tools.
